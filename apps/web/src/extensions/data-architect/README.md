# Data Architect Agent

The Data Architect is a specialist agent in Lattik Studio that helps users define data pipeline concepts through a chat + canvas workflow. It produces YAML definitions that get submitted as PRs.

## Architecture

```
User ←→ Chat ←→ Agent (Claude Haiku 4.5) ←→ Tools ←→ Canvas / DB / Gitea
```

The agent is a `ToolLoopAgent` (Vercel AI SDK v6) with a max of 10 tool steps per turn. It receives system instructions listing the available skills, and is told to always load the skill document first before starting any workflow.

### Key Behavior
- **Skill-driven:** The agent loads a skill markdown doc via `getSkill` before starting work. The skill doc is the source of truth for the workflow — the agent does not assume steps from memory.
- **Canvas-first:** Users work directly on canvas forms rather than answering questions in chat. The agent renders the form immediately, pre-populating any fields mentioned in the conversation.
- **Handoff protocol:** The agent uses `handback` to return control — `"pause"` for off-topic detours, `"complete"` when the user confirms they're done.

## Definition Types

| Kind | Description | Schema Key |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Entity** | Business concept with a unique ID (e.g. user, game) | `entities` |
| **Dimension** | Attribute of an entity (e.g. user_home_country) | `dimensions` |
| **Logger Table** | Raw, append-only event table (client SDK: `@eloquio/lattik-logger`) | `log_tables` |
| **Lattik Table** | Derived, pre-aggregated table via Column Families | `tables` |
| **Metric** | Collection of aggregation expressions | `metrics` |

## Workflow (5 steps)

All five definition types follow the same workflow:

1. **Render Draft on Canvas** — Agent outputs a `spec` code fence with the built-in form component (e.g. `LoggerTableForm`), pre-populating state from the conversation. User edits directly on the canvas or chats with the agent.
2. **AI Review** — Agent calls `reviewDefinition` and renders suggestions as `ReviewCard` components on the canvas.
3. **Accept/Deny Suggestions** — User accepts or denies each suggestion via canvas buttons. Agent reads decisions with `readCanvasState` and applies accepted changes.
4. **Static Checks** — Agent calls `staticCheck` which runs validation functions (naming, referential integrity, expression syntax). Failures return to canvas for fixes.
5. **Generate and Submit** — Agent calls `updateDefinition` to save the draft to the database, then `submitPR` to generate YAML and create a PR in Gitea/GitHub.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `getSkill` | Load a skill markdown document by ID |
| *(canvas rendering)* | Agent outputs `spec` code fences with JSONL patches — no dedicated tool |
| `readCanvasState` | Read the current form field values from the canvas |
| `reviewDefinition` | Generate AI review suggestions for a definition |
| `staticCheck` | Run validation (naming, referential, expression syntax) |
| `updateDefinition` | Save/update a definition draft in the database |
| `submitPR` | Generate YAML, create branch, commit, and open a PR |
| `listDefinitions` | List existing definitions, optionally filtered by kind |
| `getDefinition` | Fetch a specific definition by kind and name |
| `updatePipeline` | Update the full pipeline definition on the canvas |
| `handback` | Return control from the agent (`pause` or `complete`) |

## Canvas

The canvas uses `@json-render/react` for all rendering. The agent sends JSON specs, and the canvas renders them as interactive forms.

### Built-in Forms
Each definition type has a dedicated composite form component that handles the full UI:

- `EntityForm` — name, description, id_field, id_type
- `DimensionForm` — name, description, entity, source_table, source_column, data_type
- `LoggerTableForm` — name, description, retention, dedup_window, columns (with implicit columns shown)
- `LattikTableForm` — name, description, primary_key, column_families (with source/key mapping/agg), derived_columns
- `MetricForm` — name, description, calculations (expression + source_table)

### Primitive Components
Forms are built from these registered json-render components:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Section` | Group related fields |
| `Heading` | Section title with optional subtitle |
| `TextInput` | Text field bound to state (supports title/subtitle variants, multiline) |
| `Select` | Dropdown bound to state |
| `Checkbox` | Boolean toggle |
| `ColumnList` | Editable list of columns with name + type |
| `MockedTablePreview` | Read-only table with auto-generated sample data |
| `DataTable` | Static read-only table |
| `ReviewCard` | Accept/deny card for AI suggestions |
| `StatusBadge` | Colored status pill (draft, reviewing, checks-passed, etc.) |
| `ExpressionEditor` | lattik-expression input with live validation |

### State Binding
All form inputs bind to json-render state paths (e.g. `/name`, `/description`, `/user_columns`). State is two-way: components read from state and write back via `onStateChange`. Canvas state is persisted to the database with the conversation and restored on page load.

### Canvas → Chat Actions
Composite forms can send messages to the chat panel via `useCanvasActions()` from `CanvasActionsContext`. For example, `LoggerTableForm` has a "Review Table" button that sends `"Review table"` to the chat, triggering the agent's review workflow. See `docs/canvas-rendering.md` for the full data flow and how to add this to new extensions.

## Validation

Three layers of validation run during static checks:

| Layer | Module | What it checks |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Naming** | `validation/naming.ts` | snake_case, reserved words, length limits, qualified names (`schema.table_name`), retention format (`<n>d`), dedup window format (`<n>h`) |
| **Referential** | `validation/referential.ts` | Entity exists, table exists, column exists in table — all checked against merged (production) definitions |
| **Expression** | `validation/expressions.ts` | lattik-expression parse validity for agg, expr, and derived column expressions |

## Schema

All definition types are defined as Zod schemas in `schema.ts`. The YAML output is a direct serialization of these schemas via `yaml-generator.ts` — no separate YAML schema exists.
