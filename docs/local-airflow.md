# Local Airflow

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) 3.2.0 running in the same kind cluster as everything else, with `KubernetesExecutor` so each task runs in its own pod. Used for orchestrating pipelines locally without standing up a separate compose stack or pointing at a hosted Airflow.

## What's in the stack

| Component | Role | Image | Port (in cluster) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **api-server** | FastAPI HTTP server. Serves the UI, the v2 REST API, and the execution API that worker pods call back into. Replaces Airflow 2.x's `webserver`. | `lattik/airflow:3.2.0` | `8080` |
| **scheduler** | Decides what runs when. Spawns worker pods for queued task instances via the Kubernetes API. | `lattik/airflow:3.2.0` | — |
| **dag-processor** | Parses DAG files on disk and writes serialized DAGs to the metadata DB. Mandatory in Airflow 3 (was embedded in the scheduler in 2.x). | `lattik/airflow:3.2.0` | — |
| **airflow-init** (Job) | One-shot: creates the `airflow` database in the existing postgres, then runs `airflow db migrate`. | `lattik/airflow:3.2.0` + `postgres:16-alpine` initContainer | — |
| **worker pods** | Spawned on demand by the scheduler. Run a single task, post results back to the api-server's execution API, exit. | `lattik/airflow:3.2.0` (driven by `pod_template.yaml`) | — |

The metadata DB is **not** a separate pod — it's an `airflow` database inside the existing `postgres` Service ([`k8s/postgres.yaml`](../k8s/postgres.yaml)). The init Job creates it idempotently before running migrations.

A few things about this picture worth knowing:

- **Workers do not talk to postgres directly.** Airflow 3 routed all task↔metadata-DB traffic through the api-server's `/execution/` endpoint. Workers authenticate with a JWT signed by `AIRFLOW__API_AUTH__JWT_SECRET`. This is the single biggest behavioral change from 2.x and the most common source of "worker started but immediately died" confusion if the secret isn't propagated everywhere.
- **The dag-processor is its own deployment.** In Airflow 2.x the scheduler also parsed DAG files. In 3.x that's now a separate process; you can't run Airflow without it. The processor's only output is rows in the `serialized_dag` table — once it writes those, the scheduler reads them from the DB without ever touching the file.
- **All four pods (api-server, scheduler, dag-processor, workers) hostPath-mount the same DAG dir.** The dag-processor is what *parses* them, but workers also need them on disk to import the DAG file at task execution time, and the api-server uses them to render code in the UI.
- **The `airflow` and `lattik_studio` databases coexist in the same postgres pod.** They share the cluster but not the schema — there's no FK between Airflow's metadata and the app's tables. This is deliberate: Airflow's schema is owned by the Airflow upgrade tooling, not by Drizzle.

## Bringing it up

```bash
# Just Airflow (assumes the cluster + postgres are already up)
pnpm airflow:start

# Or as part of the full dev env
pnpm dev:up
```

`airflow:start` is a chained `kubectl apply` + waits:

1. `kubectl apply -f k8s/airflow.yaml` — applies RBAC, Secret, ConfigMaps, init Job, the three Deployments, and the api-server NodePort Service.
2. `kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/airflow-init` — blocks until the `create-db` initContainer (postgres-alpine) creates the `airflow` database and the main container's `airflow db migrate` finishes. Typical: 30–60s on a cold cache, ~10s once images are local.
3. `kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=airflow-api-server` — blocks until the api-server's `/api/v2/monitor/health` probe returns 200. Typical: 60–90s after the init job finishes (DB connection pool, schema load, FastAPI startup).

To tear it down without touching anything else:

```bash
pnpm airflow:stop
```

This deletes everything in [`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml) — Deployments, Service, init Job, ConfigMaps, Secret, RBAC. The `airflow` database in postgres is **not** dropped, so a subsequent `pnpm airflow:start` will reuse the existing schema and DAG history. To start completely fresh, see [Upgrades and resets](#upgrades-and-resets).

## DAG authoring workflow

DAGs come from a hostPath mount: `/var/lib/lattik/airflow-dags/` on your laptop is bind-mounted into every Airflow pod at `/opt/airflow/dags`. The dag-processor scans that directory on a loop and writes parsed DAGs to the metadata DB; the api-server reads from the DB to render the UI. **No pod restart is required** to pick up a new or modified DAG — the processor's poll interval is short (a few seconds) and you'll see the DAG appear in the UI shortly after you save the file.

The repo ships two kinds of DAG files:

- [`airflow/dags/example_dag.py`](../airflow/dags/example_dag.py) — a static smoke-test DAG (`print_date` → `say_hello`) that proves the worker pod path is healthy.
- [`airflow/dags/lattik_dag_renderer.py`](../airflow/dags/lattik_dag_renderer.py) — thin entry point for the **dynamic DAG renderer**. Instantiates `LattikDagRenderer` from the [`lattik-airflow`](../packages/lattik-airflow/) package, calls `.generate()` to read YAML specs from `s3://warehouse/airflow-dags/` (MinIO), and injects the resulting DAGs into `globals()`. The YAML specs are generated by the web app when a Gitea PR merges (see [Dynamic DAG rendering](#dynamic-dag-rendering) below).
- [`airflow/dags/spark_app_template.yaml`](../airflow/dags/spark_app_template.yaml) — Jinja template for SparkApplication CRs, used by the renderer's `spark` tasks.

The fastest way to set up live editing is to symlink the repo dir into the host bind-mount so anything you commit is automatically visible to Airflow:

```bash
# One-time setup (ensure the bind dir exists and is yours)
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lattik/airflow-dags
sudo chown -R "$USER" /var/lib/lattik/airflow-dags

# Symlink DAG files and templates
ln -sf "$(pwd)/projects/lattik-studio/airflow/dags"/*.py /var/lib/lattik/airflow-dags/
ln -sf "$(pwd)/projects/lattik-studio/airflow/dags"/*.yaml /var/lib/lattik/airflow-dags/
```

After that, edit DAGs in `projects/lattik-studio/airflow/dags/`, save, refresh the UI. The dag-processor logs (`kubectl logs -l app=airflow-dag-processor -f`) will show the file being re-parsed.

**When you DO need a restart:**
- Adding or upgrading a Python package the DAG imports — the import happens inside the worker pod, which is built from the worker image. New deps require a custom image (see [Adding providers and dependencies](#adding-providers-and-dependencies)).
- Changing pod template fields (e.g. mounting a new volume) — the scheduler re-reads the template on next task launch, but in-flight workers keep the old spec.
- Changing any `AIRFLOW__*` env var on the api-server / scheduler / dag-processor — `kubectl rollout restart deploy/airflow-api-server deploy/airflow-scheduler deploy/airflow-dag-processor`.

## Dynamic DAG rendering

Rather than hand-writing Python DAGs for each pipeline, Lattik generates them from YAML definitions in S3. The flow:

```
Gitea PR merges
  → webhook fires (apps/web/src/app/api/webhooks/gitea/route.ts)
  → generateDags() reads all merged lattik_table definitions from the DB
  → generates one DAG YAML per table, uploads to s3://warehouse/airflow-dags/
  → Airflow's dag-processor imports lattik_dag_renderer.py
  → renderer reads YAML from S3, builds DAG objects, injects into globals()
  → DAGs appear in the Airflow UI
```

### DAG YAML schema

Each file in `s3://warehouse/airflow-dags/` defines one DAG:

```yaml
dag_id: lattik__user_daily_stats
description: "Build user_daily_stats lattik table"
schedule: null
tags: [lattik, lattik_table]
default_args:
  owner: lattik
  retries: 2
  retry_delay_minutes: 5
tasks:
  - task_id: wait__ingest_click_events
    operator: wait
    config:
      table: ingest.click_events
    dependencies: []
  - task_id: build__user_daily_stats
    operator: spark
    config:
      job_type: lattik_table
      job_name: user_daily_stats
    dependencies:
      - wait__ingest_click_events
```

### Task types

| Operator | Implementation | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `wait` | `DataReadySensor` (custom, in the renderer) | Pokes the Iceberg REST catalog until the source table exists. Checks `GET /v1/namespaces/{ns}/tables/{table}` — returns 200 when the table is ready. |
| `spark` | `SparkKubernetesOperator` (from `apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes`) | Renders [`spark_app_template.yaml`](../airflow/dags/spark_app_template.yaml) with `job_type`, `job_name`, and `{{ ds }}`, then submits a SparkApplication CR in the `workloads` namespace. Always runs the same driver Python file; arguments distinguish what the job does. |

### Caching

The renderer caches the S3 listing for 60 seconds (configurable via `LATTIK_DAG_CACHE_TTL`) to avoid hitting MinIO on every dag-processor scan cycle.

### RBAC

Airflow worker pods (which execute the `SparkKubernetesOperator`) run with the `airflow` ServiceAccount in the `default` namespace. A cross-namespace RoleBinding in [`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml) grants this SA permission to create, watch, and delete SparkApplication CRDs in the `workloads` namespace.

### Key files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`packages/lattik-airflow/`](../packages/lattik-airflow/) | Python package — `LattikDagRenderer` class, `DataReadySensor`, S3 + YAML + DAG logic |
| [`airflow/dags/lattik_dag_renderer.py`](../airflow/dags/lattik_dag_renderer.py) | Thin entry point — instantiates `LattikDagRenderer`, calls `.generate()`, updates `globals()` |
| [`airflow/dags/spark_app_template.yaml`](../airflow/dags/spark_app_template.yaml) | Jinja template for SparkApplication CRs |
| [`apps/web/src/lib/dag-generator.ts`](../apps/web/src/lib/dag-generator.ts) | TypeScript — generates DAG YAML from merged definitions |
| [`apps/web/src/lib/s3-client.ts`](../apps/web/src/lib/s3-client.ts) | TypeScript — MinIO S3 client wrapper |

## Auth and the UI

[`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml) sets `AIRFLOW__CORE__AUTH_MANAGER` to `SimpleAuthManager` and `AIRFLOW__CORE__SIMPLE_AUTH_MANAGER_ALL_ADMINS=True`. The result: the login page accepts any credentials (or none — just click Sign In) and grants admin access. **This is local-dev only.** SimpleAuthManager is documented as not suitable for production; the lattik-studio app talks to Airflow via the v2 REST API with token auth, not by fronting the UI publicly, so this is a deliberate trade-off for fast iteration.

UI: <http://localhost:8088> (NodePort 30888 → host 8088, mapped in [`k8s/kind-config.yaml`](../k8s/kind-config.yaml)).

## Custom image and providers

The bare `apache/airflow:3.2.0` image ships almost no providers. We use a custom image `lattik/airflow:3.2.0` built from [`k8s/airflow/Dockerfile`](../k8s/airflow/Dockerfile) that installs the [`lattik-airflow`](../packages/lattik-airflow/) package. This package declares its own dependencies (`boto3`, `apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes`), so they come in automatically:

- **`lattik-airflow`** — the `LattikDagRenderer` class, `DataReadySensor`, and supporting logic.
- **`boto3`** (transitive) — so the renderer can read YAML specs from MinIO (S3).
- **`apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes`** (transitive) — provides `SparkKubernetesOperator` for submitting Spark jobs.

Build and side-load it into kind:

```bash
pnpm airflow:image-build
```

This runs `docker build` and `kind load docker-image` in one step. All Airflow pods (api-server, scheduler, dag-processor, workers) already reference `lattik/airflow:3.2.0` in [`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml). The `dev:up` script runs `airflow:image-build` automatically before `airflow:start`.

**To add more providers,** add them to the `dependencies` list in [`packages/lattik-airflow/pyproject.toml`](../packages/lattik-airflow/pyproject.toml), or add extra `pip install` lines to [`k8s/airflow/Dockerfile`](../k8s/airflow/Dockerfile), and re-run `pnpm airflow:image-build`. Then restart Airflow pods:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deploy/airflow-api-server deploy/airflow-scheduler deploy/airflow-dag-processor
```

**Don't use `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS`.** It's a convenience env var that runs `pip install` on every pod startup. It works for a one-off prototype, but: (a) every worker pod pulls and installs again, adding 10–60s of cold-start latency per task; (b) it bypasses the lockfile, so you can't reproduce failures; (c) network flakiness will fail tasks for reasons unrelated to your DAG.

## Upgrades and resets

**Upgrading Airflow patch versions** (e.g. 3.2.0 → 3.2.1):

The schema is stable across patch releases. Bump the image tag everywhere in [`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml), `pnpm airflow:stop && pnpm airflow:start`. The init Job's `airflow db migrate` is a no-op if the schema is already at head; it'll exit clean and the new pods come up against the existing DB.

**Upgrading Airflow minor versions** (e.g. 3.2.x → 3.3.x):

Same procedure — `db migrate` handles minor-version schema bumps. Apache's compatibility policy is "you can always migrate forward within a major version." Read the release notes for any breaking config changes, but the manifest dance is identical to a patch upgrade.

**Upgrading Airflow major versions** (e.g. 2.x → 3.x):

Non-trivial. The 2→3 jump in particular has breaking changes to executor config, the auth manager, the webserver→api-server split, and the worker connectivity model (workers no longer talk to postgres directly). For local dev, the fastest path is **drop the database and re-init**:

```bash
pnpm airflow:stop
kubectl exec -it deploy/postgres -- psql -U lattik -d lattik_studio -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS airflow'
# bump image tags + any config in k8s/airflow.yaml
pnpm airflow:start    # init job recreates the DB and runs db migrate against the new schema
```

You lose DAG run history, connections, and variables — fine for local dev, not a thing you'd do in prod. For prod migrations the [official upgrade guide](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/upgrading_to_airflow3.html) is the source of truth.

**Wiping just Airflow's state without touching the cluster:**

```bash
pnpm airflow:stop
kubectl exec -it deploy/postgres -- psql -U lattik -d lattik_studio -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS airflow'
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/lattik/airflow-logs/*    # optional — just for tidiness
pnpm airflow:start
```

DAG files in `/var/lib/lattik/airflow-dags/` are not touched.

## Troubleshooting

**`http://localhost:8088` doesn't respond**

Almost always the kind port mapping. kind only reads `extraPortMappings` at cluster-creation time, so adding `8088` to [`k8s/kind-config.yaml`](../k8s/kind-config.yaml) only takes effect after `pnpm dev:down && pnpm dev:up`. Confirm with:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=lattik-control-plane --format '{{.Ports}}'
```

If you don't see `0.0.0.0:8088->30888/tcp`, the cluster is on an old config. Either recreate the cluster, or as a quick workaround: `kubectl port-forward svc/airflow-api-server 8088:8080`.

**`airflow-init` Job fails with `database "airflow" does not exist` or similar**

The `create-db` initContainer didn't finish before the main `airflow-init` container started. Look at both:

```bash
kubectl logs job/airflow-init -c create-db
kubectl logs job/airflow-init -c airflow-init
```

The `create-db` container waits on `pg_isready` so it shouldn't race, but if postgres was in the middle of a restart at the moment Airflow was applied, the readiness loop may bail before postgres is actually accepting connections. Re-running `pnpm airflow:start` is usually enough — the Job is idempotent.

**Worker pod starts but immediately fails with 401 / 403 hitting the api-server**

JWT secret mismatch. The worker's `AIRFLOW__API_AUTH__JWT_SECRET` must match the api-server's. Both are read from the `airflow-secret` Secret in [`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml), but if you've edited the manifest and forgotten to wire the env var into the worker pod template (it's separate from the Deployments), you'll see this. Check:

```bash
kubectl get secret airflow-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.jwt-secret}' | base64 -d
kubectl logs <worker-pod-name>   # look for 'JWT' / 'unauthorized'
```

**Worker pod starts but immediately fails with `connection refused` to `airflow-api-server:8080`**

The worker pod template doesn't have `AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTION_API_SERVER_URL` set, or it points at the wrong Service name. Should be `http://airflow-api-server:8080/execution/` — note the trailing `/execution/`, not just the host.

**Scheduler logs say `Forbidden: pods is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:default:airflow" cannot create resource "pods"`**

RBAC missing. The Role + RoleBinding in [`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml) grant `pods`, `pods/log`, `pods/exec`, and `events` to the `airflow` ServiceAccount. If you've narrowed the manifest, restore those rules.

**DAG appears in `/var/lib/lattik/airflow-dags/` but not in the UI**

Tail the dag-processor logs — it's the only component that writes to the `serialized_dag` table:

```bash
kubectl logs -l app=airflow-dag-processor --tail=100 -f
```

Look for `Errors found in DAG file` or `Failed to import` lines. A common gotcha is that `BashOperator`/`PythonOperator` imports moved between Airflow 2 and 3 — old DAG files copied from 2.x docs may need import fixes.

**`kubectl logs` for a worker pod returns nothing because the pod is gone**

`AIRFLOW__KUBERNETES_EXECUTOR__DELETE_WORKER_PODS=True` deletes worker pods on success (we keep them on failure for debugging — `DELETE_WORKER_PODS_ON_FAILURE=False`). For successful runs, look at the task logs in the UI instead — they're persisted to the hostPath log dir at `/var/lib/lattik/airflow-logs/dag_id=.../`, so they survive pod deletion.

**Memory pressure: kind node OOMs or Airflow pods evict**

Airflow 3 has more processes than 2.x — api-server + scheduler + dag-processor each request ~256–512Mi, plus 256–512Mi per concurrent worker pod. If you're also running trino (which alone wants ~1Gi), the kind node's memory budget gets tight. Bump Docker Desktop's memory to at least 8 GB. Cheap wins if you can't: drop replicas, lower the resource requests in [`k8s/airflow.yaml`](../k8s/airflow.yaml), or `pnpm trino:stop` when you're not using the data lake.
